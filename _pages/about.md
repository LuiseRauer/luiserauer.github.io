I am a postdoctoral researcher in computational biology, focusing on bis detection and correction in microbiome sequencing data. My [research](https://luiserauer.github.io/research/) centers on reducing contamination in low-biomass samples, overcoming extraction bias, and improving reproducibility and reporting standards through the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). I also apply these approaches in clinical contexts, specifically in studies on skin microbiomes and allergic diseases.
