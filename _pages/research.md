Microbiome and host co-factors in Atopic Dermatitis
------
Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) usually have a reduced microbial diversity and overabundance of Staphylococcus aureus on their skin. We found that host cofactors, like IgE levels and race, may be key to the relation between microbiome composition and AD severity. And what does "low diversity" actually mean? Check out our full answer as [published in JEADV](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.18776) and corresponding [data analyses in R on Github](https://github.com/LuiseRauer/Anti-IL22-baseline). 

Bioinformatic contaminant removal for microbiome data
------
Contaminants can spoil any microbiome sequencing experiment, but particularly those of sparsely-inhabited body regions like the skin. Our tool MicrobIEM bioinformatically reduces contaminants, and can be used through a graphical user interface with interactive figures. Try it out [online](https://env-med.shinyapps.io/microbiem/) or give us feedback on the [source code on Github](https://github.com/LuiseRauer/MicrobIEM).

Open science, reproducibility and biases in microbiome research
------
With a plethora of methods available for generating microbiome data, are microbiome results actually comparable? In this meta-analysis of microbiome studies, we are investigating the reproducibility of methods sections in scientific papers, and how laboratory choices affect your final microbiome conclusions. Check out some first results in my [Github repository](https://github.com/LuiseRauer/Mock-meta-analysis/blob/main/Mock-meta-analysis_pilot-results_2022-09-29.pdf).
